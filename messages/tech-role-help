**Greetings earthlings!** :wave:

As you can see we have a bot to help you assign your roles easily, this means while the staff can sit back in their deck chair, grab a tan and not have to worry about being nudged because some kid needs adding to a certain role. Thanks to Pablo for painting the bot on a canvas for us and to the bot itself for being the best bot we can have.



**Tutorial**: `How to assembly your roles`

1. **Choose nicely your tech role you want to be assigned!** <:developer:292241752792760322>
