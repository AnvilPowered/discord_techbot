Bill Gates is that you? Oh wait no it's **you** fellow tech follower!

It looks like our super evil robots have captured you and sent you here, well don't worry we won't hurt you.. yet. In the mean time make sure to read our rules you don't bypass our firewall and become a virus which we may have to terminate,

Speaking of the firewall did anyone see our technician? I heard he got hurt pretty bad.

Anyway the rules:

1. Don't be that guy who can't code so just spams their keyboard, I mean come on guys spamming is a no go.

2. Treat each other with respect, even if you disagree on some topics, tech is very controversial at points so please we need those
sweet 1's and 0's sparing for nice conversations. :D

3. What's that you need help? Don't worry we should have regulars and tech helpers there on hand, and if not feel free to DM or ping one of the higher bandwidths.
